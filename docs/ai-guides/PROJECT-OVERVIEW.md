## General Purpose

Relativa is a **multi-tenant CRM / sales-workspace platform**. It lets organizations manage clients, deals, and workspaces with role-based access control, graph visualization of entity relationships, and ML-driven scoring (closure probability, churn risk). The system is designed for sales teams that need structured pipelines with analytics.

## Business Domain

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Organization** | **Primary multi-tenant boundary.** Users must join an organization before accessing workspaces. Owns workspaces directly (`workspaces.organization_id` FK). Has its own roles, members, join requests, and invitations. |
| **Workspace** | Isolated working area within an organization. Has a creator (User) and members. Entities belong to workspaces via `EntityWorkspace`. |
| **UserRoleOrganization** | Join between User, Organization, and OrganizationRole. A user can be in multiple organizations with different roles. |
| **UserRoleWorkspace** | Join between User, Workspace, and WorkspaceRole. A user can be in multiple workspaces with different roles. Must be an org member first. |
| **OrganizationJoinRequest** | Tracks pending/approved/rejected requests from users wanting to join an organization. |
| **OrganizationInvitation** | Email-based invitation to join an organization. Carries an email, a target org role, and an expiry date. |
| **User** | A person with credentials. Has no global role -- roles are scoped to each organization and workspace membership. |
| **OrganizationRole** | Named role scoped to an organization (e.g. `org_owner`, `org_admin`, `org_member`). Linked to permissions via `OrganizationRolePermission`. `OrganizationId` is nullable: `null` for system roles, set for custom org-specific roles. |
| **WorkspaceRole** | Named role scoped to a workspace (e.g. `ws_admin`, `ws_manager`, `ws_analyst`, `ws_member`). Linked to permissions via `WorkspaceRolePermission`. `WorkspaceId` is nullable: `null` for system roles, set for custom workspace-specific roles. |
| **Permission** | Granular capability shared by both org and ws role hierarchies. Includes org `manage_org_workspace_members` (add/remove users in any workspace of that org) and workspace `add_ws_members` / `remove_ws_members` for workspace-local admins. |
| **EntityType** | Named type discriminator (`client`, `deal`). Extensible — new types can be added by inserting a row. Includes `is_standalone` for UI/navigation (top-level types vs child-only types such as `deal_analysis`). |
| **Entity** | A business record typed by `EntityType`. Lives in workspaces via `EntityWorkspace`. All entity types share the same EAV storage — no per-type tables. |
| **Property** | A named attribute definition with a data type (`String`, `Int`, `Decimal`, `Bool`, `Date`). Global (`organization_id = NULL`) or org-specific (`organization_id` set). |
| **EntityTypeProperty** | Schema-layer mapping: which `Property` definitions belong to which `EntityType`, with an `is_required` flag. Composite PK on `(entity_type_id, property_id)`. |
| **EntityPropertyValue** | Data-layer storage: one row per entity+property pair holding the actual typed value. Only one of `value_string / value_int / value_decimal / value_bool / value_date` is populated per row. |
| **EntityRelationshipType** | Schema-layer definition of a valid directed link between two entity types (e.g. `deal_client`: deal → client). Includes `is_required` so create flows can mandate a linked target (distinct from `EntityTypeProperty.is_required` on scalar fields). |
| **EntityRelationship** | Data-layer instance of a directed link between two entity records, typed by `EntityRelationshipType`. Replaces the old hard-coded `deal_property_values.client_id` FK. |

The domain model lives entirely in the shared Persistence library (`Persistence/src/Relativa.Persistence/Entities/`).

### User flow

1. **Register** → user has no memberships.
2. **Create or join an organization** → user becomes an org member with an org role (creator gets `org_owner`).
3. **Create or join a workspace** within the organization → user becomes a ws member with a ws role (creator gets `ws_admin`). Workspace creation requires the `create_workspaces` org permission.
4. **Work within the workspace** → RBAC governs what the user can do (manage settings, invite members, edit deals, view analytics, etc.).

## Repository Layout

Relativa is a **monorepo**. Each service has its own .NET solution (or package manager for non-.NET). There is no single root `.sln`.
