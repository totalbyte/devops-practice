## Implemented (working)

### Authentication service

- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` -- creates user, hashes password with bcrypt, stores email lowercase, returns user DTO with 201 + Location header. Newly registered users have no organization or workspace membership. **Re-registration:** after an account was soft-archived (`DELETE /me` or org admin delete), the same normalized email may be used again (new `users` row); uniqueness applies only to non-archived rows.
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` -- validates credentials (email compared after lowercase normalization), issues JWT with claims: `sub`, `email`, `jti`. Role and permissions are **not** included in the JWT -- they are resolved per-request by Core using organization/workspace membership.
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` -- returns authenticated user's profile (`id`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`) from JWT `sub` claim. Requires valid JWT.
- `PATCH /api/v1/auth/me` -- updates first and last name for the authenticated user.
- `DELETE /api/v1/auth/me` -- soft-archives the authenticated user (`users.is_archived`); the email is then free for a new registration subject to the partial unique index and `IUserRepository.ExistsAsync` (active users only).
- Full clean-architecture layers: Domain interfaces, Application services (`AuthService`, `UserProvisioningService`) + DTOs + FluentValidation validators, Infrastructure (AuthDbContext, UserRepository, JwtTokenService, BcryptPasswordHasher).
- GlobalExceptionHandler maps ValidationException -> 400, UnauthorizedAccessException -> 401, KeyNotFoundException -> 404, duplicate **active** email -> 409 (including PostgreSQL unique violation on concurrent register of two non-archived users with the same email).
- EF Core health check at `/health`.
- OpenAPI + Scalar docs.
- Fire-and-forget audit publishing: register flow writes to `audit_outbox`, dispatcher publishes to RabbitMQ.

### Core service -- Organization management

- **Organization CRUD:** `POST /api/v1/organizations` (create, creator becomes `org_owner`; auto-seeds `organization_settings` row with `join_policy='open'`), `GET` (list user's orgs), `GET /search?q=...` (search by name), `GET /{id}` (details, requires org membership), `PUT /{id}` (update, requires `manage_org_settings`).
- **Organization settings:** `GET /{id}/settings` (returns `description`, `joinPolicy`, `defaultOrgRoleId/Name`; requires org membership; audited), `PUT /{id}/settings` (full replace; requires `manage_org_settings`; validates description ≤ 500 chars, `joinPolicy` IN `['open','invite_only']`, valid role id when set; audited + `core.organization.settings_updated` domain event). **Join policy enforcement:** when `joinPolicy = 'invite_only'`, `JoinRequestService.SubmitAsync` throws 403 so non-invited users cannot file join requests. **Default role:** `defaultOrgRoleId` is applied when approving join requests and when no explicit role is given on invitations.
- **Organization members:** `GET .../members` (list, requires org membership), `DELETE .../members/{userId}` (another user: `remove_org_members` **and** caller org role must strictly outrank target by role `priority`; self-remove allowed without permission), `PUT .../members/{userId}/role` (change role, requires `assign_org_roles`).
- **Organization users (account provisioning):** `POST .../users` (create user + add with optional `orgRoleId`; requires `create_org_users`, and `assign_org_roles` when non-default role is selected), `PATCH .../users/{userId}` (edit another member's name, requires `edit_other_org_users_profile`), `DELETE .../users/{userId}` (archive user account, requires `delete_org_users`, same email domain between caller and target, and caller org role **strictly outranks** target by `organization_roles.priority`; **403** if targeting self). Implemented via Core orchestration + shared `UserProvisioningService` from Authentication.Application. Creating a user with an email that exists only on archived accounts succeeds (same rules as self-register).
- **Join requests:** `POST .../join-requests` (request to join), `GET .../join-requests` (list pending, requires `manage_join_requests`), `PUT .../join-requests/{reqId}` (approve/reject, requires `manage_join_requests`), `GET /api/v1/join-requests/mine` (own requests). Protected by a partial unique index `(organization_id, user_id) WHERE status='Pending'` so a user cannot file two simultaneous requests for the same org.
- **Organization invitations:** `POST .../invitations` (invite by email + optional `orgRoleId`, requires `invite_to_org`; non-default role additionally requires `assign_org_roles`), `GET .../invitations` (list pending, non-expired, includes `roleName`), `DELETE .../invitations/{invId}` (cancel), `POST .../invitations/{invId}/resend` (rotate token + extend expiry), `POST /api/v1/invitations/accept-org` (accept — adds user with the invitation's recorded role). Protected by a partial unique index `(organization_id, lower(email)) WHERE status='Pending'` and an in-service check that the email does not already resolve to an existing org member.
- **Organization roles:** `GET .../roles` (list system + custom, requires org membership), `POST .../roles` (create custom, requires `manage_org_roles`), `PUT .../roles/{roleId}` (update), `DELETE .../roles/{roleId}` (delete). System roles cannot be modified.

### Core service -- Workspace RBAC

- **Workspace CRUD:** `POST /api/v1/workspaces` (create within an org, requires `create_workspaces` org perm + `organizationId`; creator becomes `ws_admin`), `GET` (list user's workspaces), `GET /{id}`, `PUT /{id}` (requires `manage_ws_settings`), `DELETE /{id}` (archive, requires `ws_admin` role).
- **Workspace settings:** `GET /{id}/settings` (returns `description`, `highRiskThreshold`, `mediumRiskThreshold`, `riskScoringEnabled`; requires ws membership; audited), `PUT /{id}/settings` (full replace; requires `manage_ws_settings`; validates thresholds 0–1, medium < high, description ≤ 500 chars; audited + `core.workspace.settings_updated` domain event).
- **Member management:** `GET .../members`, `POST .../members` (add org member; requires workspace `add_ws_members` **or** org `manage_org_workspace_members` on the parent organization), `PUT .../members/{userId}/role` (requires `assign_ws_roles`), `DELETE .../members/{userId}` (requires `remove_ws_members` or org `manage_org_workspace_members`, or self-remove).
- **Role management:** `GET .../roles` (list system + custom), `POST .../roles` (create custom, requires `manage_ws_roles`), `PUT .../roles/{id}` (update), `DELETE .../roles/{id}` (archive). System roles cannot be modified.
- **Combined invitations inbox:** `GET /api/v1/invitations/mine` — pending **organization** invitations for the caller's email (`{ organizationInvitations }`); `GET /api/v1/invitations/mine/organization` — same as flat list. `POST /api/v1/invitations/accept-org` — accept org invite (documented under organization invitations).
- **Permission listing:** `GET /api/v1/permissions` — lists rows in `permissions`. Workspace entity permissions are split into **`create_entities`**, **`edit_entities`**, and **`delete_entities`** (replaces legacy `manage_entities`); see migrations reseeding `workspace_role_permissions`.
- Full clean-architecture layers: Domain (repository interfaces), Application (10 services, DTOs, validators), Infrastructure (repositories, WorkspaceContext).
- Authorization checked per-request via `UserRoleOrganization` or `UserRoleWorkspace` DB lookup. **Core does not parse JWTs**; it reads the caller identity from the `X-User-Id` header that the Gateway injects after JWT validation (see Gateway entry below). `X-User-Email` is read on invitation-accept flows. Missing headers are treated as a 401.

### Core service -- Entity CRUD

- **Entity types (public):** `GET /api/v1/entity-types` — anonymous (no JWT required via Gateway); returns entity types with EAV properties (`isReadonly`), `isStandalone`, `outgoingRelationships` (incl. `isRequired`, `relationshipCardinality`).
- **Entity CRUD (workspace-scoped):** all endpoints under `/api/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/entities`:
  - `GET /` — list non-archived entities; optional `entityTypeId`, `q`, `take`; requires `view_entities`.
  - `GET /{entityId}` — detail including archived rows, `isReadonly` per value, inbound/outbound relationship previews; requires `view_entities`.
  - `POST /` — create with optional **links** (`relationshipTypeId`, `targetEntityId`); enforces standalone, readonly, and required-outgoing rules; requires **`create_entities`**.
  - `PATCH /{entityId}` — partial property update; readonly columns rejected only if the user **changes** the value (carry-forward of existing readonly values is allowed); requires **`edit_entities`**.
  - `DELETE /{entityId}` — soft-delete (`is_archived = true`); requires **`delete_entities`**.
- **Workspace DTO:** list/detail responses include **`myPermissions`** for the caller's effective workspace permission names (drives SPA gates).
- **GlobalExceptionHandler extended:** `KeyNotFoundException` → 404, `ValidationException` → 400 with error detail.
- Fire-and-forget audit publishing for core write flows via `audit_outbox` + RabbitMQ dispatcher, including organizations/workspaces/entities, join requests, invitations, membership updates, and role lifecycle changes.
- **Graph command path:** Core hosts **`EntityGraphCommandConsumerHostedService`** — consumes Rabbit graph-create RPC and calls the same **`EntityService.CreateAsync`** as HTTP (shared validation + per-entity audit).

### Gateway

- YARP reverse proxy with 5 route groups: `/auth/*`, `/core/*`, `/graph/*`, `/ml/*`, `/audit/*`.
- Path prefix stripping via `PathRemovePrefix` transforms.
- JWT Bearer authentication with full validation (issuer, audience, signing key, lifetime). **Core** does not re-validate tokens (uses forwarded `X-User-Id`). **Authentication** validates its own tokens for `/me`. **Audit** re-validates JWTs for its read API (configuration aligned with Gateway). **Graph/ML** are stubs.
- **Global authorization via `MapReverseProxy().RequireAuthorization()`.** Every proxied route requires a valid JWT unless it is explicitly marked `AuthorizationPolicy: Anonymous` in `appsettings.json`.
- **Identity forwarding via YARP request transform:** on every proxied request the Gateway unconditionally strips any incoming `X-User-Id` / `X-User-Email` headers, then re-adds them from the validated `ClaimsPrincipal` (`sub` and `email` claims). **Core** trusts these headers and does not parse JWTs. **Audit** validates JWTs (defense in depth) and still accepts forwarded headers when resolving identity. Client-supplied header values are always overwritten at the Gateway.
- **Split anonymous/auth routes:** `/login` and `/register` are anonymous; `/me` (GET/PATCH/DELETE) requires JWT.
- Anonymous exceptions for health endpoints.
- **CORS:** named-origin allowlist with credentials, reading `Cors:Origins` from config (defaults to `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:3000`).
- Forwarded headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`).
- Serilog request logging.
- GlobalExceptionHandler.
- OpenAPI + Scalar docs.
- Health endpoint at `/health`.

### Migration

- `MigrationDbContext` mirrors full Persistence model (20 entities after removal of workspace invitation entities).
- `Program.cs` runs `Database.MigrateAsync()` as a generic host console app.
- Migrations in `Migration/src/Relativa.Migration/Migrations/` include (non-exhaustive):
  - `20260416224419_InitialCreate.cs` — full initial schema (RBAC, org management, old polymorphic entity tables).
  - `20260416224514_SeedData.cs` — seeds all reference data. Permission ids 14/15 are `manage_entities`/`view_entities`.
  - `20260423000000_EavSchemaReplace.cs` — EAV schema migration: drops old property tables, renames entity tables to singular, creates new EAV tables.
  - `20260423100000_ReseedPermissions.cs` — FK-safe wipe and full re-insert of `permissions`, `organization_role_permissions`, `workspace_role_permissions`; replaces `edit_deals`/`view_deals` with `manage_entities`/`view_entities` for existing databases.
  - `20260503194004_AddPerformanceIndexes.cs` — composite/DESC indexes for RBAC/invitations/join requests/audit tables/outbox; drops redundant single-column indexes; unique constraint on `entity_workspace (entity_id, workspace_id)`.
  - `20260503235000_InvitationSystemProdGrade.cs` — adds `organization_invitations.org_role_id` (FK, backfilled to `org_member`); creates `workspace_join_requests` table; adds partial unique indexes on pending org/workspace invitations and join requests; seeds `manage_ws_join_requests` (id 20) for `ws_admin`. **Superseded for fresh DBs** by `20260504180000_RemoveWorkspaceInvitationFlows.cs`, which drops workspace invitation/join-request tables and permission ids 9/20 and adds `manage_org_workspace_members` (id 21).
- Docker Compose runs this before auth and core start.

### Persistence library

- 20 CRM-facing entity classes in the Core/Migration model (workspace invitation / workspace join-request entities removed; performance indexes unchanged for remaining tables).
- Split RBAC model: separate `OrganizationRole`/`OrganizationRolePermission` and `WorkspaceRole`/`WorkspaceRolePermission` hierarchies sharing a common `Permission` table.
- **EAV entity model:** `Property`, `EntityTypeProperty`, `EntityPropertyValue`, `EntityRelationshipType`, `EntityRelationship` replace the old hard-coded `EntityProperty` / `PersonalDataPropertyValue` / `LocationPropertyValue` / `DealPropertyValue` tables.
- `ModelBuilderExtensions.ApplyAuthEntityConfigurations()` for auth-only subset (User).
- `ModelBuilderExtensions.ApplyAllEntityConfigurations()` for full model mapped by Core/Migration contexts.
- Referenced by Core, Authentication, and Migration via ProjectReference.

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`: per-service lint → build → test jobs (`.NET` matrix ×7, `Python · ml`, `Vue · client`), all independent and parallel with dependency caches.
- Static analysis is blocking: `dotnet format` against the root `.editorconfig`, Ruff (`ML/pyproject.toml`), ESLint + `vue-tsc` (`Client/eslint.config.js`); findings appear as PR annotations.
- `images` job builds every Dockerfile once, scans it with Trivy (SARIF to the Security tab + blocking scan on fixable HIGH/CRITICAL) and hands the image to later jobs as an artifact.
- `publish` pushes to `ghcr.io/<owner>/relativa-<service>` on push events only (`sha-<7>` tag always, `latest` on `main`).
- Pull requests additionally run Playwright E2E and the k6 load test (`tests/load/relativa.js`, replaces NBomber) against the freshly built images via `docker-compose.images.yaml`.
- New test suites added with the pipeline: `Gateway/tests/Relativa.Gateway.Tests` (JWT, prefix stripping, identity-header spoofing, CORS), `Migration/tests/Relativa.Migration.Tests` (EF model vs. migrations), Client Vitest specs (`src/**/__tests__`). ML `test_happy_path_scores` fixed (it predated the missing-input diagnosis). Integration suites now use the default Testcontainers Postgres readiness check instead of a port check (removed `57P03` flakiness).
- Details, required checks, and local commands: [CI-PIPELINE.md](CI-PIPELINE.md).

### Docker Compose

- Full 10-service stack with dependency ordering.
- Single bridge network `relativa_net`.
- Named volume `postgres_data` for persistent DB.
- Environment variable injection for DB, JWT, and YARP config.
- Migration runs to completion before dependent services start.

### Client

- Vue 3 + Vite scaffold with TypeScript, Pinia, Vue Router.
- **UI stack:** PrimeVue 4 (Aura preset) + Tailwind CSS 3 (`tailwindcss-primeui` bridge) + Inter font.
- **Typed API client** (`src/api/http.ts`): `gatewayFetch` with JWT + `X-Workspace-ID` headers (workspace id read from the workspace store), `ApiError` class, JSON helpers (`api.get/post/put/patch/del`). Auto session clear on `401` is **scoped to auth endpoints only** (`/auth/me`, `/auth/refresh`) — generic `401`s on business endpoints surface as `ApiError` so a transient permission change does not log the user out.
- **Centralized error handling** (CR-127, `src/api/errors.ts` + `src/api/errorToast.ts`): `normalizeError(err, fallback)` consumes any `ApiError` / `Error` / network failure and returns a `NormalizedError` with friendly `message`, status flags (`isValidation`, `isUnauthorized`, `isForbidden`, `isNotFound`, `isConflict`, `isServer`, `isNetwork`), and a `fieldErrors` map parsed from the backend `{ status, title, detail }` shape (FluentValidation `detail` of the form `"Field: msg; Field2: msg"` is split into per-field arrays; field names are lower-cased to match camelCase form bindings). `useApiErrorHandler()` is a thin composable over PrimeVue's `useToast()` — `notify(err, { fallback, summary, silent })` shows a categorized red error toast and returns the same `NormalizedError` so callers can also react to specific statuses. Forms render server `fieldErrors` inline under the corresponding inputs (red text + `pi pi-exclamation-circle`); each input clears its own server error on `update:model-value`. List/dialog views display non-form errors via toasts (replaces previous silent `catch {}` blocks).
- **Auth service** (`src/api/auth.ts`): `authApi.register`, `authApi.login`, `authApi.me`, `authApi.updateMe` (PATCH `/me`), `authApi.deleteMe` (DELETE `/me`).
- **Organization service** (`src/api/organizations.ts`): org CRUD, members, invitations, join requests, roles, combined invitations (`/invitations/mine`), admin user CRUD (`orgApi.createOrgUser`, `orgApi.updateOrgUserProfile`, `orgApi.deleteOrgUser`).
- **Workspace service** (`src/api/workspaces.ts`): workspace CRUD, members, roles; `WorkspaceDto` includes optional **`myPermissions`**.
- **Entity service** (`src/api/entities.ts`): typed DTOs including relationship refs and `isReadonly` on values; `entityApi.list` supports list filters; `entityApi` CRUD under `/core/.../workspaces/{id}/entities`. **`entityGraph.ts`**: optional `POST /graph/.../entity-graph/create`.
- **Audit service** (`src/api/audit.ts`): typed DTOs mirroring the BE `AuditLogListResponse` (data + total + page + perPage + filterContext) and `AuditLogEntryDto` (actor, contextual entity/workspace/organization/targetUser, propertyChanges); `auditApi.list(query)` builds a query string for `GET /audit/audit-log` with `entity_type` (scope), `workspace_id`/`organization_id`, `date_from/date_to`, `action`, 1-based `index`, `page_size`, etc. Audit Pinia store (`src/stores/audit.ts`) caches `rows`, `total`, `page`, `perPage` and exposes `fetchRows(query)`.
- **Auth store** (Pinia) persists `accessToken` + `expiresAt` in `localStorage`; stores `user` profile from `/me`; exposes `login`, `register`, `logout`, `fetchProfile`, `updateProfile`, `deleteAccount`; `isAuthenticated` respects token expiry.
- **Organization store** (Pinia) manages current org selection (persisted in `localStorage`), members, roles, invitations; exposes `createOrganization`, `inviteMember`, `createOrgUser`, `deleteOrgUser`, `changeMemberRole`, `removeMember`, `fetchOrganizations`, `hasOrganization`.
- **Workspace store** (Pinia) manages current workspace selection (persisted in `localStorage` under `relativa_ws_id`), workspaces list, members, roles, invitations; exposes `setCurrentWorkspace`, `fetchWorkspaces`, `createWorkspace`, `updateWorkspace`, `archiveWorkspace`, member/role/invitation actions, `clear`.
- **Layouts:** `AuthLayout.vue` (centered card, brand mark) and `MainLayout.vue` (top bar: org name, user name as link to `/account`, sign out; sidebar: Home, org section with Members, Graph, Workspaces, role-gated *Audit log*, role-gated *Settings* (→ `/org-settings`, visible only when `manage_org_settings`); workspace shell section with Dashboard, Members, *Settings* (→ `/w/:id/settings`, visible to all workspace members)). The workspace section of the sidebar (visible only when `route.path` matches `/w/{id}`) renders **Entities** as a parent link (no filter) with **dynamic per-type sub-items** (one `RouterLink` per standalone `EntityTypeDto`, e.g. *Client*, *Deal*, *Contract*); each sub-item navigates to `workspace-entities` with `?entityType=<name>`. Types are fetched lazily via `entityStore.fetchTypes()` the first time the user enters a workspace shell. Home uses `exact-active-class` so it does not stay highlighted when navigating to nested routes. The standalone top-level *Members* link was removed — workspace member management is under *Workspaces → Manage members*; org-level `MembersView` remains on route `/members` without a sidebar entry.
- **Views:** `LoginView.vue`, `RegisterView.vue`, `OnboardingView.vue`, `WorkspaceSelectorView.vue`, `AccountSettingsView.vue`, `MembersView.vue`, `MemberView.vue`, `WorkspacesView.vue`, `WorkspaceMembersView.vue`, `InvitationsView.vue`, `EntitiesView.vue` (query-driven: `entityType`, `id` → `EntityReadView`, `action=create` → embedded `EntityCreateForm`; server list filters via `q` / `entityTypeId`; row click opens detail), `EntityCreateForm.vue` (required outgoing link pickers + optional Graph orchestration), `EntityReadView.vue`, `HomeView.vue`, `GraphView.vue` (full graph: org-scoped, fetches from graph service, vis-network render with dynamic entity-type color palette, node action panel with View/Edit/Delete, loading/empty/error states), `OrgSettingsView.vue` (route `/org-settings`; sections: General — description `Textarea`; Membership — join policy `Select`, default role `Select` populated from org roles; gated by `manage_org_settings`; read-only info `Message` when caller lacks permission), `WorkspaceSettingsView.vue` (route `/w/:workspaceId/settings`; sections: General — description `Textarea`; Risk Scoring — `ToggleSwitch` + `InputNumber` thresholds; gated by `manage_ws_settings`).
- **Routes:** `/account` → `AccountSettingsView.vue` (`account`); `/members/:memberUserId` → `MemberView.vue` (`member`); `/w/:workspaceId/entities` → `EntitiesView.vue` (`workspace-entities`); `/w/:workspaceId/entities/new` **redirects** to `workspace-entities?action=create`; `/audit-log` → `AuditLogView.vue` (`audit-log`); `/org-settings` → `OrgSettingsView.vue` (`org-settings`); `/w/:workspaceId/settings` → `WorkspaceSettingsView.vue` (`workspace-settings`).
- **AuditLogView** (`src/views/AuditLogView.vue`, CR-186): PrimeVue `DataTable` in `lazy` mode driven by the audit store; columns Date / Type / Action / Author (email) / Target (clickable entity link) / Old/New value (per-cell collapsible JSON `<pre>` blocks). Filters bar with scope `Select` (entity / workspace / organization / users — options pruned by caller's role), `DatePicker` range (serialized to ISO via `toISOString()`), action `InputText`, *Apply* / *Reset*. Server-side pagination via the DataTable `@page` event (PrimeVue zero-based → BE one-based `index`). Page itself is gated with `v-if` on the same role check used by the sidebar; unauthorized callers see a locked placeholder instead of the table.
- **Router guards:** `meta.public`, `meta.guestOnly`, `meta.skipOrgCheck`, and `meta.skipWorkspaceCheck` flags. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` with `?redirect=<original>` query; authenticated users cannot visit `/login` or `/register`; authenticated users without an organization are sent to `/onboarding`; authenticated users with an organization but no current workspace are sent to `/workspace-select` (which auto-selects when only one workspace is available, preventing a needless extra screen). On a hard refresh, when `auth.isAuthenticated` is true but `auth.user` is null, the guard now eagerly calls `auth.fetchProfile()` so views like `HomeView.vue` always have an email/name to render.
- **Graph:** `GraphView.vue` at route `/graph` (org-scoped, not workspace-scoped). Fetches from `GET /graph/api/v1/graph?organizationId={id}` via new `graphApi`. Renders vis-network with: focal user center node (brand-700), workspace nodes (teal-600), per-entity-type palette colors (assigned dynamically at render time by discovery order — not hardcoded to type names), user nodes (brand-300). Edge types: `user_workspace` (solid brand), `workspace_entity` (solid slate), `entity_entity` (dashed with arrow + relationship type label), `user_user` (solid brand-200). Click a node → detail panel (type badge, label, subtitle, View/Edit/Delete buttons gated by `node.permissions`). Delete triggers `useConfirm` dialog → `entityStore.archive` → graph reload. Sidebar Graph link is in the org section (alongside Members), not workspace section.
- Reads `VITE_GATEWAY_URL` from environment; all traffic goes through the gateway.

## Stubs / Partially Implemented

### Core service -- remaining gaps

**What is missing:**
- No business rules (BP-01 through BP-06).
- No generalized domain-event catalog beyond workspace choreography pilot + audit payloads.
- **No email notifications for invitations or join request outcomes (intentional).** Invitation tokens are returned in the POST response and surfaced as a copy-link in the UI. The token-in-response / copy-link UX is intentional for this iteration — integrating a real SMTP/transactional-email provider is out of scope. Resend rotates the token and bumps `ExpiresAt` but still returns the new token inline.
- No property management endpoints (list/create/update org-scoped custom properties).
- Relationship **admin** REST for arbitrary `entity_relationship` rows deferred — creates/updates still persist links via **entity create** and graph/Core transactions.

### Graph service

**What exists:** Full `GET /api/v1/graph?organizationId={int}` endpoint returning RBAC-filtered nodes + edges. `GraphQueryDbContext` for read queries via `ApplyAllEntityConfigurations()`. `GraphDataService` (6 DB queries: focal user, org permissions, accessible workspaces+permissions, entities+labels, entity relationships, org members). `GraphGlobalExceptionHandler` for API errors. SignalR hub at `/hubs/graph`, workspace `DomainEventConsumerHostedService`, and `POST .../entity-graph/create` RPC entry point.
**What is missing:** `OnConnectedAsync` only calls `base`. No RBAC-scoped SignalR hub groups. No ML score integration on graph nodes.

### Audit service

**What exists:** RabbitMQ consumer (`audit.#`) with idempotency; persistence into all four audit tables. **`GET /audit-log`** and **`GET /entities/{entityId}/audit-log`**: `date_from` / `date_to`, `action`, `index`, `page_size`, `entity_id`, `domain_entity_type`, `actor_user_id`, `target_user_id`; response `{ data, total, page, perPage, filterContext }` with actor/workspace/org/entity/target user context and optional `propertyChanges` / `propertyDefinitionsForEntityType` for entity events. **RBAC:** `ws_admin`/`ws_analyst` (entity + workspace), `org_owner`/`org_admin` (organization), user-scope visibility rules. **GlobalExceptionHandler** + **FluentValidation**; **full JWT validation** (issuer, audience, key, lifetime). See [AUDIT-LOG-API.md](AUDIT-LOG-API.md).
**What is missing:** Scalar/OpenAPI browser for Audit (only `MapOpenApi` in dev).

### ML service

**What exists:** `POST /api/ml/score/batch` endpoint (request: `{"entity_ids":[int,...]}`) with 5-second timeout budget, null-safe per-entity scoring, and stale-data fallback recomputation. The response is `[{ entity_id, closure_score, churn_score, unavailable_reason }]`; when scoring is impossible, `closure_score` / `churn_score` are `null` and `unavailable_reason` carries a user-facing explanation (no analysis row, missing `created_at`, unrecognised `status`, no linked contract + no `deal_value`, contract amount missing, etc — see `_diagnose_missing_inputs` in `ML/ml_api/views.py`). `POST /api/ml/recalculate/` now supports async enqueue (`202 + job_id`) for both explicit `entity_ids` and workspace mode. `run_domain_consumer` subscribes to `core.workspace.*` and `core.entity.*` (freshness updates), while `run_recalculate_consumer` handles queued recomputation jobs (`ml.recalculate.enqueued`). Both use `rabbitmq_processed_delivery` idempotency receipts. `closure_score` and `churn_score` exist as system-readonly `deal` properties (joining the eight `deal_analysis` features already flagged in `AddPropertyIsReadonly`); actual write-back of the live model output into `entity_property_value` is still pending — the SPA reads scores on demand via the gateway.
**What is missing:** Celery tasks are still not implemented. Redis broker is not in Docker Compose. Beat schedule remains commented out in `settings.py`. Score persistence into `entity_property_value` rows on a recalculation cycle is not wired up.

### Client

**What exists:** Vue 3 + PrimeVue + Tailwind scaffold. Auth (login/register) + org onboarding + workspace selection + `/account` profile + member management (invite, role change, remove, join-request review for org admins, org-permission-based edit of another member’s profile) + workspace CRUD via Gateway. Typed API clients. Router guards with org and workspace checks.
**What is missing:** No custom role creation UI. No dashboard. "Forgot password?" is a placeholder (no backend). D3 integration noted for later.

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication README outdated** | Low | `Authentication/README.md` claims endpoints return 501 stubs. In reality, login, register, and `/me` are fully implemented. |
| **Migration README outdated** | Low | `Migration/README.md` describes an `entrypoint.sh` flow. Actual code uses `MigrateAsync` in `Program.cs`. |
| **Gateway README partially outdated** | Low | `Gateway/README.md` says JWT validation is a stub. Gateway now fully validates JWT. |
| **Unused package reference** | Trivial | `Asp.Versioning.Http` is referenced in `Authentication/src/Relativa.Authentication/Relativa.Authentication.csproj` but never used in code. |
| **Core CORS is `AllowAnyOrigin`** | Low | Gateway now has a proper named-origin CORS allowlist (reads `Cors:Origins` from config). Core retains `AllowAnyOrigin/Header/Method` as a dev convenience since Core is only reached via the gateway in deployed environments; tighten for production. |
| **Client image runs the Vite dev server** | Medium | `Client/Dockerfile` starts the Vite dev server (`node_modules/.bin/vite`) with dev dependencies instead of serving the `vite build` output (e.g. multi-stage build → nginx). Fine for local compose and CI E2E, not for production. Its esbuild 0.25 binary (Go 1.23 stdlib CVEs) is accepted in `.trivyignore` until 2027-03-31; fix together with a vite 7+ upgrade and the nginx image. |
| **ML model pickles pinned loosely** | Low | `closure_model.pkl` / `churn_model.pkl` were saved with scikit-learn 1.9.0, but `ML/pyproject.toml` allows `>=1.9,<1.10`; newer patch versions log `InconsistentVersionWarning` on load. |
| **Moderate advisories in MailKit/MimeKit 4.11.0** | Low | Reported by NuGet audit for Core and Authentication; below the CI Trivy gate (HIGH/CRITICAL). Bump when convenient. |
| **ML reads the host-mapped `DB_PORT` inside the container** | Medium | `docker-compose.yaml` passes `DB_PORT: ${DB_PORT}` (the *host* port of Postgres) to `ml`, and `ML/relativa_ml/settings.py` uses it to reach `postgres` on the internal network. Works only while `DB_PORT=5432`; changing it in `.env` to avoid a local port clash breaks ML's DB connection. Pass the container port (5432) instead. |
| **Backend services publish host ports** | Medium | Compose publishes 8081–8086 (plus 5432, 5672/15672) on the host, while Core/Graph trust `X-User-Id` on the assumption that only the Gateway can reach them (see ARCHITECTURE "Trust boundary"). Anyone with access to the host can call Core directly with a forged header. Acceptable for local development only. |
| **Migration image runs on the .NET SDK** | Low | `Migration/Dockerfile` uses `sdk:10.0` as the runtime stage (~1.3 GB). The console app only needs `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:10.0` plus `postgresql-client` for `entrypoint.sh --truncate`. |
| **No code-coverage gate in the new CI** | Low | The previous workflow enforced ≥ 80 % line/branch coverage per assembly (ReportGenerator + `ci/coverage/*.runsettings`). The new pipeline uploads TRX test results only; `ci/coverage/` is currently unused. Re-add a coverage job or delete the folder. |
| **`silent` request option is a no-op** | Trivial | `ApiRequestInit.silent` in `Client/src/api/http.ts` is documented to suppress the centralized error toast, but the HTTP layer never consumed it (the unused `parseResponse` parameter was removed for ESLint). Callers in `api/auth.ts` still pass it. Either wire it up or drop it. |
| **Documentation drift (known, not yet fixed)** | Low | Found while building the CI; intentionally left for a separate docs pass: DOCKER-SETUP.md says `Jwt__Secret` / `auth-cluster` (compose uses `Jwt__SecretKey` / cluster `auth`), its topology diagram and env table omit RabbitMQ, MailHog, `RABBITMQ_*`, `SMTP_*`, `DB_HOST`, `MIGRATION_TRUNCATE_DB`; ARCHITECTURE.md claims only the Gateway publishes a host port (see row above); PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md and the "Migration README outdated" row above say `entrypoint.sh` is unused, but `Migration/Dockerfile` runs it (`--truncate` support); README.md links a missing `docs/USER-GUIDE.md`; DOCKER-BUILD.md mentions `DEFAULT_ROLE_ID`, which `.env.example` does not define; the Gateway section above still calls Graph/ML stubs. |
| **Unused Auth dependencies** | Low | `IRoleRepository`, `RoleRepository`, and `AuthOptions` remain in the Auth codebase but are no longer registered in DI or used. Can be removed in a cleanup pass. |

## Roadmap (from READMEs and code comments)

### Core service -- business API

- ~~CRUD endpoints for entities (EAV-based).~~ *(done — entity-type listing + full CRUD under workspaces)*
- ~~EAV validation service (required properties, typed value parsing).~~ *(done — enforced in EntityService)*
- ~~Workspace isolation for entity queries.~~ *(done — EntityWorkspace join enforced on every read)*
- Property management endpoints: list/create/update org-scoped custom properties.
- ~~Entity relationship management endpoints (`entity_relationship` table exists; API surface deferred).~~ *(done — `POST`/`DELETE`/`PUT` entity-relationship endpoints implemented; `PUT` supports generic reassignment of required or optional relationships)*
- Business rules BP-01 through BP-06 (referenced in `Core/README.md`, not defined in code).
- Domain events published to Audit after entity mutations.
- Email notifications for invitation sends, join request approvals/rejections. *(Intentionally deferred — see Stubs section; token is returned in the response and surfaced as a copy-link in the UI.)*

### Authentication

- Token refresh flow (`POST /refresh`).
- Token blacklisting.
- `Jwt:RefreshTokenDays` is configured (7 days) but not used.

### Gateway

- Per-route permission checks (currently authorization is delegated to Core).

### Graph service

- Recursive CTE queries for entity-relationship traversal using `entity_relationship` and `entity_relationship_type`.
- Dynamic RBAC-based filtering of graph data (workspace-scoped via `entity_workspace`).
- ~~Live SignalR push updates when workspaces change via choreography envelope.~~ *(partial — choreography consumer broadcasts workspace lifecycle but no entity-graph projection yet)*.
- ML score integration on graph nodes. `closure_score` / `churn_score` exist as readonly deal properties; Graph uses **RabbitMQ RPC** (`relativa.graph_ml` exchange) to request scores from ML (`run_graph_score_consumer`), replacing the earlier HTTP call. The SPA renders scores including `unavailable_reason`. Persisting scores into `entity_property_value` on a recalculation cycle is still pending.

### Audit service

- ~~Query/filter + pagination on audit log.~~ *(done)*
- ~~JWT validation aligned with Gateway.~~ *(done)*
- Deeper report export (CSV/PDF) and dedicated UI.

### ML service

- ~~scikit-learn models for `closure_score` and `churn_score`.~~ *(done — models are loaded and used by `/api/ml/score/batch`)*
- ~~Celery task implementation for batch recalculation.~~ *(replaced by RabbitMQ async recalculate workflow via `/api/ml/recalculate/` + `run_recalculate_consumer`)*
- Redis broker added to Docker Compose.
- Celery beat nightly schedule (02:00 UTC) enabled.
- ~~Integration with Core (read deal data)~~ *(partial — Core emits `core.entity.changed`; ML consumes and marks analysis freshness)* and Graph push of updated scores.

### Client

- ~~Login and register forms wired to Gateway auth endpoints.~~ *(done in CR-96)*
- ~~Organization onboarding (create / search & join).~~ *(done in CR-96)*
- ~~Organization member management (list, invite, role change, remove).~~ *(done in CR-96)*
- ~~Workspace selection (post-login gate with auto-select-when-one).~~ *(done in CR-133)*
- ~~Entity create form (Sprint 1 ENT.5 — dropdown of types + dynamic property fields driven by `GET /entity-types`).~~ *(done in CR-138)*
- ~~Minimal entity list view as the landing place after a successful create.~~ *(done in CR-138 follow-up)*
- Workspace management UI (rename, archive from list).
- ~~Join request review UI (approve/reject pending requests).~~ *(done — org-scoped in `MembersView.vue` with `manage_join_requests` gating; workspace join requests removed.)*
- Role and permission management UI.
- ~~Entity detail / edit / archive pages (Sprint 2).~~ *(done — `EntityReadView` + permission-gated PATCH/DELETE + relationship navigation.)*
- Dashboard with analytics.
- D3-based graph visualization (replacing vis-network placeholder).
- Password reset flow (requires new backend endpoint).

### Infrastructure

- ~~CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar).~~ *(done — see [CI-PIPELINE.md](CI-PIPELINE.md))*
- ~~Test projects (at minimum: unit tests for Application services, integration tests for API endpoints).~~ *(done — every service has a test suite that runs in CI)*
- Deployment stage (CD) consuming the GHCR images.
- Client production image: multi-stage `vite build` → nginx, plus vite 7+ upgrade (removes the esbuild entries from `.trivyignore`, which expire 2027-03-31).
- Extend Dependabot from GitHub Actions to NuGet, npm, and pip.
- Production-ready CORS configuration.
- TLS/HTTPS for production deployment.
